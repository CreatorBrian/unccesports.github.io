        <h1>Hi there, This is UNCC Esports!</h1>
        <p>Join our Facebook group! <em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/unccesports/">Click Here!</a></em></p>
        <p>This is the website for the official student organization Esports at UNC Charlotte!

This group was made to create a community for students to meet awesome new people, make friends, and share incredible moments through an activity we all enjoy - gaming.

We aim to turn a group of decentralized students and gamers into an inclusive, enjoyable community for everyone. This page also gives you a way to keep up with gaming and social events at UNC Charlotte.

Don't consider yourself a gamer? Our club isn't only about playing games - it's about meeting new people and building friendships. Even if you don't play games, there are several opportunities at our events where you could fit right 
into the community.

Don't play 'X' Game? We host events for ALL types of video games, whether they are on PC or console.

Please do not solicit accounts, products, or services here.
